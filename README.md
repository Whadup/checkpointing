# checkpointing

A small library to store checkpoints of intermediate results and resume long-running computations.

### Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Whadup/checkpointing
```

## Usage

```python
from checkpointing import checkpointed_function

@checkpointed_function
def long_running_computation():
    # long running computation
    return result

long_running_computation()
```

This will store the result in `.cache/` and load it if the function is called again.


## Internals

This library uses the `inspect` module to get the source code of the function. It then hashes the source code to create a unique identifier for the function. This identifier is used to store the result of the function in `.cache/` as a binary  file using the library `dill`. We can avoid evaluating the function when the source hash and all arguments match. When results of a checkpointed function are passed to another checkpointed function, the arguments match if they correspond to the same cached file. When the source of a class for a returned object has changed, the function is always recomputed.
Results of functions are shallowly inspected, so returning tuples, dicts or lists is treated accordingly. 

Warning: When the source of a function or method used in a checkpointed function is changed, we do not detect this change, as source code is not inspected recursively.
